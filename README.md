# Real-time Noise Suppression Plugin (VST2, LV2, LADSPA)

A real-time noise suppression plugin for voice based on [Xiph's RNNoise](https://github.com/xiph/rnnoise). [More info about the base library](https://people.xiph.org/~jm/demo/rnnoise/).

## About

The plugin is meant to suppress a wide range of noise origins ([from original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.08243.pdf)): computer fans, office, crowd, airplane, car, train, construction. 

From my tests mild background noise is always suppressed, loud sounds, like clicking of mechanical keyboard, are suppressed while there is no voice however they are only reduced in volume when voice is present. 

The plugin is made to work with 2 channels, 16 bit, 48000 Hz audio input. It seems to work also with mono channels and 44100 Hz. Other sample rates may work, or not...

## How-to

### Windows + Equalizer APO (VST2)

To check or change mic settings go to "Recording devices" -> "Recording" -> "Properties" of the target mic -> "Advanced".

To enable the plugin in Equalizer APO select "Plugins" -> "VST Plugin" and specify the plugin dll.

### Linux

#### Pulseaudio

The idea is:

- Create a sink from which apps will take audio later and which will be the end think in the chain.
- Load the plugin which outputs to already created sink ('sink_master' parameter) and has input sink ('sink_name' parameter, sink will be created). 
- Create loopback from microphone ('source') to input sink of plugin ('sink') with 1 channel.
 

```
pacmd load-module module-null-sink sink_name=mic_denoised_out  

pacmd load-module module-ladspa-sink sink_name=mic_raw_in sink_master=mic_denoised_out label=noise_suppressor_mono plugin=/path/to/librnnoise_ladspa.so control=50

pacmd load-module module-loopback source=your_mic_name sink=mic_raw_in channels=1
```

This should be executed every time pulse audio is launched. This can be done by creating file in ~/.config/pulse/default.pa with:

```
.include /etc/pulse/default.pa

load-module module-null-sink sink_name=mic_denoised_out  
load-module module-ladspa-sink sink_name=mic_raw_in sink_master=mic_denoised_out label=noise_suppressor_mono plugin=/path/to/librnnoise_ladspa.so control=50
load-module module-loopback source=your_mic_name sink=mic_raw_in channels=1

set-default-source mic_denoised_out.monitor
```

For stereo input use:

`label=noise_suppressor_stereo`

and

`channels=2`

You can get `librnnoise_ladspa.so` either by downloading latest release or by compiling it yourself.

Your mic name can be found by:

```
pacmd list-sources
```

You may still need to set correct input for application, this can be done in audio mixer panel (if you have one) in 'Recording' tab where you should set 'Monitor of Null Output' as source.

Plugin settings:

- VAD Threshold (%) - if probability of sound being a voice is lower than this threshold - silence will be returned.

By default VAD threshold is 50% which should work with any mic. For most mics higher threshold `control=95` would be fine.
Without the VAD some loud noises may still be a little bit audible when there is no voice.

There is also an implicit grace period of 200 milliseconds, meaning that after the last voice detection - output won't be silenced for 200 ms.

Useful detailed info about pulseaudio logic [toadjaune/pulseaudio-config](https://github.com/toadjaune/pulseaudio-config).

The [thread](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101043) which helped me with how to post-process mic output and make it available to applications.

### MacOS

You will need to compile library yourself following steps below.

It is reported that VST plugin works with Reaper after removing underscore from lib name.

## Status

The plugin is tested with Equalizer APO v1.2 x64 (open source system-wide equalizer for Windows) and tested with pulse audio on arch linux.

I'm not associated with the original work in any way and have only superficial understanding of it. The original author will probably create something better out of their work but for now I don't see any analogs with similar capabilities so I have created a usable one.

## Developing

VST sdk files aren't shipped here due to their license. You need to download VST sdk and copy several files to src/pluginterfaces/vst2.x/ and to src/vst2.x/. You can find sdk [here](https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html).

LV2 and LADSPA sdk files are in repository.

All improvements are welcomed!

### Compiling

For Windows you either need mingw or hope it works with visual studio cmake generator.

For MacOS steps are the same as for Linux.

If you did not download and place VST sdk files - VST plugin won't be built.

Compiling for x64:
```
cmake -Bbuild-x64 -H. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cd build-x64
make 
```

Compiling for x32:
```
cmake -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-m32 -D CMAKE_C_FLAGS=-m32 -Bbuild-x32 -H. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cd build-x32
make
```

Cross-compiling for Windows x64:
```
cmake -Bbuild-mingw64 -H.  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=toolchains/toolchain-mingw64.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cd build-mingw64
make
```
